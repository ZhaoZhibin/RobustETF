## About
One important step in time series analysis is the extraction of an underlying trend. However, the true trend is often submerged by complex background noise, espcially non-Gaussian noise or outliers. Accurate trend extraction against outliers from a raw signal is a challenging task. To address this challenge, this paper extends $l_1$ trend filtering to a robust enhanced trend filtering called RobustETF by combining mix of Gaussian (MoG) and non-convex sparsity-inducing functions. We first model the noise as a MoG distribution to allow RobustETF to be robust in the presence of any type of non-Gaussian noise or outliers. After that, to handle the biased estimation of the $l_1$ norm, we use the Gibbs distribution embedding smoothed and non-convex sparsity-inducing functions to faithfully preserve the amplitude of the trend. Furthermore, we design an extended EM algorithm to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Finally, we show the results of experiments on both real-world and synthetic data to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm against other state-of-the-art methods.
